# Darkbot
A reimagining of [Lightbot](https://www.lightbot.com/) made with [Scratch Blocks](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-blocks).

## WIP
This is a work in progress, not much to see here… just yet.

## How to launch
Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [node.js](https://nodejs.dev/how-to-install-nodejs) and [yarn](https://nodejs.dev/how-to-install-nodejs). Open your terminal and execute these commands:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:m93a/darkbot.git
cd darkbot
yarn
yarn start
```
